# Geospattial Data Exploratiion and Image Segmentation with GeoAi

## Introduction

Geospatial Data is crucial in various fields, including remote sensing, environmental science, and urban planning. The advancements in AI have lead to new opportunities for analyzing and interpreting such data. This docuemnt explores the combination of Geospatial AI (GeoAI) with image segmentation techniques.

## Overview of GeoAi

GeoAI combines geospatial data and artifical intelligence to improve decision-making process. Using models such as the **Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2)**, researchers can automate feature extraction from remote sensing images.

### Key componnents of GeoAI

- **Deep learning models** for classfication and detection
- **Remote sesning data** from satellites and drones
- **Big data processing** with cloud computing solutons

## Image Segmentation using SAMGeo

Segemntation of images helps in object idntification, boundry detection, and landcover clasification. SAMGeo, a package developeed for geospattial aplications, enbales users to segment high-resolution images accuratly.

**Steps to use SAMGeo:**

1. Load remote sesning imagery
2. Apply Segement Anything Model
3. Extract features and perform post-procesing
4. Visualize results using `leafmap`

## Conlusion

GeoAi offers imense potential for enhacing geospatila analysis and envrionmental monitoring. As technolgy continues to develope, the fusion of AI and geospatila data will lead to more acurate and effiient solutions.
